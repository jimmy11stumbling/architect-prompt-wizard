We are given query " areCP and do integrate?"

 : "CP".
 the of and,M" stands " Control". However in contexts, in and cloud computing it refer something.
 Another is thatCP forMultiCloud" " Cloud". without context we consider most interpretations.

 : the domain.
 query about and integration so's in technical context.
 In cloud computing MCP refer toMulti- Platform or " Cloud". are and platforms help manage clouds.
