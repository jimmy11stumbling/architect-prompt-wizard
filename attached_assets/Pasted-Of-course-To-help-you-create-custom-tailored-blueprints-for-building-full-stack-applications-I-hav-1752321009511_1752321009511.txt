### Professional Developer Tools (IDEs & CLIs)

These platforms are not for no-code users but are powerful AI assistants for professional engineers. Blueprints using these tools would focus on workflow automation, complex refactoring, and leveraging their agentic capabilities.

*   **Cursor:** An AI-first IDE forked from VS Code, designed for professional developers. It uses a mix of frontier models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) and its own purpose-built models for features like multi-line autocomplete. Its agent can handle end-to-end tasks, and "Max Mode" allows models to use their full context windows on large codebases.[1, 97, 2, 4, 5, 98, 6, 8, 9, 99, 100, 52, 93, 101]
*   **Windsurf:** A VS Code fork competitor to Cursor, focused on creating a "flow state" for developers. It uses its own proprietary **SWE-1** models, which are fine-tuned for software engineering tasks. Its **Cascade** agent is "flow-aware," tracking all user actions to infer intent and anticipate next steps.[102, 103, 7, 10]
*   **Claude Code:** A security-first, terminal-based CLI tool from Anthropic. It provides unopinionated, low-level access to Claude models for agentic coding. It is highly scriptable and extensible via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing it to orchestrate external tools like GitHub and databases directly from the terminal.[104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111]
*   **Gemini CLI:** Google's open-source, terminal-based AI agent. It uses a ReAct loop and built-in tools (grep, file I/O, web search) to perform complex tasks. It offers a very generous free tier with access to the Gemini 2.5 Pro model and its 1M token context window. It is also extensible via MCP.[112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 12, 118, 119, 120]
