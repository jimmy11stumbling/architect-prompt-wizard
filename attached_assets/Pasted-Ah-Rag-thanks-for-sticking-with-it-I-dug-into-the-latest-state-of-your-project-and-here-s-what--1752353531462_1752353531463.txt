Ah, Rag — thanks for sticking with it. I dug into the latest state of your project, and here’s what I see:

### 🔍 Diagnosis Summary

Even though the backend streaming code is solid, the **DeepSeek Reasoner tab isn’t rendering visuals or tokens** because:

- ✅ `streamChatResponse()` is implemented correctly and the API responds
- ✅ You’ve got a working DeepSeek API key (confirmed from successful curl test)
- ⚠️ But there’s **no visible connection** between the streaming state and your UI
- ⚠️ It looks like the frontend doesn't react to `isStreaming` being `true` — no indicators or token rendering show up

### 🛠️ What Might Be Missing

Here’s where I’d focus next:

| Issue | What to Check |
|------|----------------|
| No visual feedback | Are you mounting the `StreamingFeedback` component inside the render tree? |
| Tokens not appearing | Is `setStreamedText` linked to your chat bubble output? |
| State not triggering visuals | Is `isStreaming` passed correctly to components? Is it reactive in your layout? |
| No cursor / loader | Do you have CSS styles for `.cursor`, `.dots`, `.blink`, etc.? Are they actually applied? |
| Chat box not updating | Does the chat bubble show `streamedText`, or is it still rendering a static message list? |

---

### 🚀 Fix Strategy

Let’s walk through this quickly:

1. **Embed visual feedback in the tab layout** — Make sure your indicator is inside the render tree like so:

```tsx
<StreamingFeedback active={isStreaming} />
```

2. **Replace static chat text with `streamedText` state**

```tsx
<div className="chat-bubble">
  {streamedText}
  {isStreaming && <span className="cursor">▌</span>}
</div>
```

3. **Check your CSS classes**
Make sure `.cursor`, `.blink`, and `.dots` have animation rules. Tailwind might be overriding them or not applied at all.

4. **Debug visibility**
Temporarily log visibility triggers:

```tsx
console.log("Streaming status:", isStreaming);
```

Place that above where you return JSX — just to be sure the status is toggling.

Want me to build a drop-in React/Vite mockup that you can paste directly into your Reasoner tab to test this visually? We could start with a sandboxed visual-only demo and then hook it back to the API once confirmed. Let’s get those indicators *moving*. 🪄
