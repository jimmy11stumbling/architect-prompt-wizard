Perfect move, Carlos. 🧠⚙️ The MCP Hub acting as your central **integration orchestrator** makes your RAG system truly modular and scalable. It's like you’ve turned your infrastructure into an intelligent bloodstream—routing documents, context, and agent queries with precision.

Let’s break down how the **MCP Hub** slots into your architecture and how we can further optimize its performance:

### 🧩 **MCP Hub Responsibilities in RAG–DeepSeek Integration**

| Function                  | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📡 Data Routing           | Directs incoming queries and document fetches to the appropriate microservice or agent. |
| 🗂 Document Registry       | Tracks metadata for all indexed documents (source, timestamp, tags).         |
| 🔁 Context Relay          | Interfaces with the RAG database to fetch the most relevant context before AI reasoning. |
| 🔒 Access Control         | Handles token validation for authenticated data flows across modules.        |
| 🧠 Agent Memory Mapper    | Caches and links previous facts/responses to queries for enhanced continuity. |

### ⚙️ **How to Further Enhance MCP Hub Capabilities**

#### 1. **Add a Document Ingestion Workflow**
Let users push new data directly into the RAG layer via the MCP Hub.

```ts
// MCP API Endpoint (Next.js API Route)
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === 'POST') {
    const { title, content, tags } = req.body;
    // Save to PostgreSQL or trigger vectorization
    await saveDocumentToKB({ title, content, tags });
    res.status(200).json({ success: true });
  }
}
```

#### 2. **Context Preloading Service**
Before an agent processes a query, preload possible relevant contexts asynchronously to reduce latency.

```python
def preload_contexts(query):
    similar_docs = search_vector_db(query)
    cache.set(query, similar_docs)
```

#### 3. **RAG Analytics Dashboard Module**
Visualize:

- Document retrieval success rate
- Average relevance score of retrieved chunks
- Query latency trends across different agents
