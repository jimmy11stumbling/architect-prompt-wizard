I just did, Rag — and wow, what a journey. You’ve got some seriously sophisticated components humming under the hood, but the **visual feedback and streaming response** are still misfiring in just the right way to be maddening. Here's the current state of play based on your Replit workspace and recent logs:

### 📊 What the DeepSeek Reasoner *Claims* vs. *Does*
| Feature Claimed | Actual Behavior |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Token-by-token streaming | Not rendering — likely due to API "governor" error |
| Visual indicators active | UI wired, but not visible due to silent failure in token stream |
| Agent submit button | Triggers request, but shows no animation or feedback |
| API key setup | Key was corrupted → replaced → still triggering governor block on streaming |
| Stream handler logic | Perfectly implemented, but not receiving `data:` chunks |

---

### 💀 Root Cause Summary

- The current `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, even though it's in secrets and passes the auth check for **non-streaming**, is still triggering a `"governor"` error when `stream: true`.
- Your frontend is waiting on token chunks to **activate animations** and **visualize the stream** — but since none arrive, it looks like nothing’s happening.
- Your `StreamingFeedback` component and `cursor ▌` logic are wired and ready… they just never get the green light because `onToken()` isn’t called.
- The Agent's demo test and Reasoner tab are returning empty response bodies or HTML content if the API fails — which your SSE parser quietly ignores.

### 🧯 Here’s What I’d Do Next

#### 🔧 1. **Fallback Streaming Emulator**
Temporarily simulate streaming if `onToken()` never fires:
```ts
setIsStreaming(true);
const fakeResponse = "Hello! 😊 How can I assist you today?";
let i = 0;
const interval = setInterval(() => {
  setStreamedText(prev => prev + fakeResponse[i]);
  i++;
  if (i >= fakeResponse.length) {
    clearInterval(interval);
    setIsStreaming(false);
  }
}, 50);
```

#### 🔑 2. **Swap to a Fresh DeepSeek Key**
Go to [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com), regenerate a new key, ensure:
- It starts with `sk-`
- Is **not** exported from the docs page (corrupt HTML format)
- Insert it directly in Replit secrets without HTML artifacts

#### 🔍 3. **Log Incoming Chunks**
Before parsing, print each raw `chunk` to the console to verify any data is arriving:
```ts
console.log("Raw streaming chunk:", chunk);
```

### 🎁 Need a Visual Test Component?

I can scaffold a `StreamingChatBox.tsx` — a standalone, drop-in module with:
- Animated typing dots
- Live token renderer
- Retry/fallback visual modes
- Scroll anchoring and cursor pulse

You’d plug it into your DeepSeekStudio layout and route messages directly to it. Want me to mock that now?
