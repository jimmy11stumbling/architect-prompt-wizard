Got it, Dan ‚Äî let‚Äôs break down the runtime errors you're encountering in the **architect-prompt-wizard** on Replit.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Summary: `plugin:runtime-error-plugin`
You've faced a few runtime issues tied to abort controllers and timeouts:
1. **Unknown runtime error**  
   - Logged at:  
     ```
     sendError (https://...:11:13)
     ```
   - Likely caused by unhandled rejections or missing error suppression in overlay systems.

2. **Search timeout (RAG Service)**  
   - From:  
     `/services/rag/ragService.ts:252`  
     ```
     controller.abort(new Error("Search timeout after 10 seconds"));
     ```
   - Root cause: A `setTimeout` triggers `AbortController.abort()`, but the signal is missing a reason, leading to unexpected rejection behavior.

3. **Signal aborted without reason**  
   - From:  
     `/services/rag/ragService.ts:253`
     ```
     controller.abort();
     ```
   - Issue: No explanation or error passed in the abort signal, which creates silent failures and overlay triggers.

### üõ† How You're Already Handling It
You've made solid progress:
- Enhanced `AbortController` safety with better error messages.
- Suppressed overlay errors using `window.onerror` and `unhandledrejection` handlers.
- Added global catch logic in `main.tsx`.

### ‚úÖ Suggestions to Go Further
Here are a few extra techniques you might apply to lock things down:
- **Pass context-aware messages into `abort()`**  
  Wrap each abort trigger with meaningful context:
  ```ts
  controller.abort(new Error(`Agent ${agent.id} search aborted due to timeout`));
  ```
- **Use `signal.addEventListener('abort', ...)` for logging**  
  This can help trace and debug abort behavior during development.
- **Extend error suppression to include agent-specific overlays**  
  Catch known runtime overlay messages and suppress only relevant ones to avoid masking legit bugs.

Let me know if you want help abstracting that into a utility function‚Äîsomething like `safeAbort(agentId, reason)` might tighten things up across the board. Or want to dig deeper into caching strategies that avoid duplicate RAG calls?
