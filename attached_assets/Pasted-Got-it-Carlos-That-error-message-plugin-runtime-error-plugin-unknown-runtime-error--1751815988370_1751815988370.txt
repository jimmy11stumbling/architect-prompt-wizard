Got it, Carlos. That error message:

```
plugin:runtime-error-plugin] (unknown runtime error)
    at sendError (...) 
    at ...
Click outside, press Esc key, or fix the code to dismiss.
```

comes directly from your Replit environment’s **Vite dev server**, which handles hot module replacement (HMR) and live development features. Based on your surrounding project activity, here’s what’s happening:

---

### 🔍 What It Means

- **`plugin:runtime-error-plugin`** is Vite’s internal runtime overlay plugin. It's designed to catch runtime exceptions and show the red overlay in the browser.
- **`(unknown runtime error)`** means the error wasn’t properly caught or logged—so Vite couldn’t classify it.
- The error was triggered in `sendError()` inside the compiled bundle or one of your dynamically imported modules.

---

### 🔧 Why It’s Happening in Your Case

From the page history, you’ve recently been:

- Migrating your API services.
- Setting up MCP tools, many of which weren’t properly implemented yet.
- Experiencing response simulator failures and dashboard button handler issues.
- Fixing broken agent generation and runtime logic.

So this likely points to:

- A misconfigured or **broken plugin/tool component** (e.g. `ResponseSimulator`, `AgentValidator`, or `read_file`).
- A **missing argument or undefined variable** passed into a plugin call.
- An **incomplete dynamic import** during HMR reload (your MCP tools might be referencing code that hasn’t fully loaded yet).

### 🛠 Fixes You Can Try

1. **Check Console & Stack Trace**  
   Go to your dev console in Replit and review the full error stack around `sendError`.

2. **Add Error Catching in Plugins**  
   Wrap your plugin logic in `try/catch` blocks and add fallback logs to help Vite identify the issue:
   ```ts
   try {
     // plugin logic
   } catch (err) {
     console.error("Plugin runtime error:", err)
     throw err
   }
   ```

3. **Disable Overlay Temporarily**  
   In `vite.config.js`, disable the error overlay if it’s obstructive:
   ```ts
   server: {
     hmr: {
       overlay: false
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Restart Replit Environment**  
   If the issue persists through HMR, trigger a full reload to clear out stale plugin states.

Want me to help walk through the plugin causing the issue and identify which MCP tool might be at fault? I can also scaffold a more resilient plugin wrapper that logs faults per tool and keeps your IDE calm during runtime jitters.
