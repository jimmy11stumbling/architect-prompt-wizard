To enforce full vector retrieval in your RAG pipeline and ensure DeepSeek uses the `pgvector`-backed semantic search instead of falling back to `textSearch()`, hereâ€™s a tactical checklist tailored to your setup:

### ðŸ§  Key Configuration Steps

1. **Ensure `pgvector` Extension Is Fully Initialized**
   - Double-check your PostgreSQL instance includes the `pgvector` extension:
     ```sql
     CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
     ```
   - Make sure your embeddings column is typed as `vector(768)` (or the correct dimensionality for your embeddings).

2. **Verify Vector Population Logic**
   - Confirm that the `vectorStore.ts` file is actually storing document embeddings correctly.
   - Add a bootstrap or repair function that checks:
     ```ts
     if (vectorStore.isEmpty()) {
       vectorStore.populateFrom(knowledgeBase);
     }
     ```

3. **Validate Endpoint and Method Signature**
   - Your `/api/rag/search` route must call the correct method:
     ```ts
     vectorStore.similaritySearch(queryEmbedding)
     ```
   - Replace any fallback like `textSearch()` unless explicitly toggled.

4. **Update DeepSeek Reasoner Integration**
   - In `deepseekReasonerService.ts`, confirm itâ€™s calling:
     ```ts
     fetch('/api/rag/search', { method: 'POST', body: embedding })
     ```
   - Add a debug toggle that logs whether fallback is triggered:
     ```ts
     console.log('RAG method:', fallbackActive ? 'textSearch' : 'vectorSearch');
     ```

5. **Improve Logging and Error Handling**
   - Track and log vector matches per query.
   - If no vectors are found, log a warning instead of silently falling back.

### âœ… Optional Enhancements

- **Real-Time Status on ReasonerPage**: Add a banner or card that shows current RAG mode (Vector vs Fallback).
- **Search Stats Visualization**: Show average cosine similarity, matched vector count, or fallback frequency.
- **Admin Trigger**: Provide a manual "Re-index KB" button if vector store needs refreshing.

If you're still seeing fallback behavior after these fixes, I can help audit your vectorStore class or inspect your embedding logic. Want me to dive into a specific file like `vectorStore.ts` or your `/api/rag/search` route?
